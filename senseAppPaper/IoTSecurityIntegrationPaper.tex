% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



\usepackage{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
The modern home is becoming increasingly filled with variety of connected devices, each providing a myriad of different and often overlapping services within the home. More recently, ``smart-appliances'' and the Internet of Things have began to enter our homes, attempting to digitize our already existing ``dumb-appliances'' and objects within the home. As these devices enter our homes in an often piecemeal fashion, bringing with them their own distinct ecosystems, protocols and standards, the user is faced with an increasingly difficult burden of managing this network of heterogeneous devices. Due to the sheer number and diversity of these devices, problems arise with respect to how these devices co-operate, as well as how to ensure the user's network and information remains secure against new and unanticipated threats.

Many existing devices present a severe lack of thoughtful integration into existing networks, infrastructure and the devices themselves. Existing approaches either integrate traditional power-hungry 802.11 WIFI chipsets or run 6LowPan, an shrunk down IPv6 for low power 802.15.4 radios. However, both of these approaches can severly limit the lifetime of a device running on batteries. With TCP/IP built into these devices, naturally many of them offer services directly to the Internet\cite{MQTT,IETF_CORE,Xively} or connect to a cloud service\cite{SmartThings,Twine}. Whilst this reaps the benefits of anywhere access and scalable power/storage, it opens up multiple points of failure by relying on such connectivity to the Internet or Cloud, including reliability, security, privacy, data-ownership, and has already resulted in attacks similar to that of Stuxnet\cite{IoTWorm}.

In this paper we present our solution for creating a low power and secure an Internet of Things for the home, by designing an entirely new protocol with the IoT model in mind and taking advantage of a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic algorithms and primitives to enable efficient, secure and authenticated entry into a new network with minimal user configuration.

% Whilst previous work has demonstrated it's possible to adequately secure wireless sensor networks from a variety of attacks\cite{TinySec,TinyECC,MiniSec}, existing research has yet to create a complete solution to enable new devices to join an existing network without the need of a shared secret (pre-shared key)\cite{TinySec,MiniSec} or complex user interaction to transfer the network key\cite{MessageBottle}.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A brief survey of existing Internet of Things approaches, as well as wireless sensor network security.
  \item An Internet of Things model describing three classes of typical Things and their operational semantics within the network.
  \item A design and implementation of a secure IoT protocol fit for purpose, for TinyOS running on the TeloB motes.
  \item A user-friendly security scheme for low-power Things, using symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to enable new trusted devices to enter the network securely with little user interaction or configuration  
\end{itemize}



% The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:background} will discuss the background of the Internet of Things and the smart home router, Homework. Section \ref{sec:motivation} will discuss the motivation behind developing a new protocol tailored specifically for the IoT, describe the issues with current approaches to security related to WSN, as well as discuss the reasons for integrating the IoT into the Homework platform. Section \ref{sec:design} will describe the design of the IoT protocol, the underlying security protocol and the architecture for integrating the IoT into the Homework router. Sections \ref{sec:asymmetric_security},\ref{sec:symmetric_security},\ref{sec:integration} discuss elements of the design in more detail. Lastly, sections \ref{sec:evaluation},\ref{sec:conclusion},\ref{sec:related_work} evaluate and compare the contributions to existing work, sum of the importance of the work and discuss related works respectively. 

\section{Motivation} % (fold)
\label{sec:motivation}
\subsection{A Secure Intranet of Things Protocol} % (fold)
\label{sub:intranet_of_things_protocol}
In recent years the Internet of Things has resurfaced once again, with it's beginnings as RFID tracked products in a warehouse stock floor, transforming into embedding low power wireless devices into everyday objects around us under the guise of ``smart-appliances''. Many manufacturers have rushed to the market with new smart devices to replace our old dumb ones, but in doing so they've thoughtlessly integrated these devices and services into our home networks and the Internet, without much thought or consideration for the device's and network's power, reliability, security and privacy. 

The first problem this paper addresses, is that many current approaches have integrated expensive wireless chipsets and/or heavyweight/inefficient protocols (IPv6/6Lowpan, TCP, MQTT\cite{MQTT}, \cite{xAP}) in to Things, or simply manipulated them to fit into the traditional RESTful client-server architecture\cite{IETF_COAP_HTTP}. However, given that many of these Things are expected to run unattended on battery power for as long as feasibly possible these approaches seem largely inappropriate. Therefore, it's necessary to engineer a new lightweight power-efficient protocol, specifically tailored for the typical IoT model, with the ability to scale up as the number of devices inevitably increases.

\subsection{Security} % (fold)
\label{sub:motivation_security}
In the context of the IoT, security is of paramount importance due to the rich and sensitive nature of the data that sensors gather, as well as the level of control available from actuators. In a similar fashion to how Stuxnet was directly targeted at machine-to-machine (M2M) networks\cite{Stuxnet}, recently there have been several significant attacks targeted towards IoT devices\cite{IoTWorm,BelkinWemo}. The latter of which over half a million users' Belkin IoT devices and home networks were vulnerable for attackers to remote control and monitor these devices, as well as allowing attackers access to the home network. This resulted in risks ranging from electricity wastage, to presence monitoring and in severe cases, possibilities of home fires being caused by the appliances attached to these devices.

Thus, the second problem this paper attempts to solve is securing the IoT in a usable manner to ensure the user's devices, network and data are secure against possible attacks and also allow new ``approved'' devices join the network with minimal effort. Due to the scale of an IoTs network, containing potentially tens if not hundreds of devices, this needs to be possible without the user being required to manually configure each device with a security key.

Deployable security in wireless sensor networks continues to be a significant problem for several reasons. Firstly, power is a major concern in WSNs; thus, running expensive conventional cryptography algorithms in order to keep transmitted data secret can be detrimental to the lifetime of a node. Secondly, WSN nodes are also extremely constrained in terms of memory (ROM/RAM), requiring cryptography algorithms to fit within extreme size constraints and is especially problematic when trying to reduce computational load by storing pre-computed tables. Lastly, being able to dynamically add new nodes to a network post-deployment as well as (re)distribute keys for the network, enables the network to scale, replace failed nodes and protect against attackers with ease. Previous work has demonstrated various solutions to the first and second part of this problem\cite{TinySec,MiniSec,TinyECC}, but have largely ignored the third part, assuming that keys or shared secrets are distributed at install time.
\textit{Types of Attack:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Eavesdropping - An attacker can overhear messages broadcast by nodes in the network, using the information learned to potentially perform a physical attack (when house doors are unlocked), or log for later analysis (activity monitoring).  
  \item Masquerading - An attacker masquerades as a legitimate node within the network and is able to inject packets into the network and abuse the closed loop of control within the network with potentially dangerous consequences e.g., transmit cold temperature readings to trick the boiler to increase the temperature.
  \item Man-in-the-middle - An attacker intercepts a communications between two nodes and is able to overhear, manipulate and inject packets without either node detecting it. 
  \item Replay - An attacker records messages between nodes in the network and rebroadcasts them in an attempt to manipulate the network. This attack can be performed even if packets are encrypted. 
  \item Denial of service - An attacker abuses the resources available on a node by overwhelming it with expensive operations e.g., verifying a certificate.
  \item Node Capture - An attacker captures a node and can retrieve any data/keys stored on the device, potentially compromising the security of the network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design} % (fold)
\label{sec:design}
The design of our secure IoT protocol is largely consists of two parts, the core IoT protocol, which encapsulates our IoT model, and the security protocol which ensures secure packet transport and entry into the network. This section will first describe our assumptions, following with the design of the IoT protocol and security scheme respectively.

\subsection{Assumptions} % (fold)
\label{sub:assumptions}
In designing the IoT protocol the following assumptions were made:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The controller role is implemented on a PC and has sufficient resources available to process and store a large number of public keys for nodes within the network.
  \item Typical sensor data is non-critical, ephemeral and frequent enough such that occasional packet loss is acceptable.
  \item The controller has sufficient resources available to generate and store secure pair-wise session keys for each node in the network.
  \item Things are typically retrofit into existing homes and structures, thus connecting these devices directly to power lines is impractical in many cases; instead Things must rely on battery power and are expected to run for as long as possible.  
  \item The network is deployed over a geographically small enough area, the home, such that it's unnecessary to perform packet gathering and compression between the source sensor and sink controller. Thus, intermediary nodes need not store keys for each of the surrounding nodes and can, if necessary, forward any encrypted packets received towards their destination.
  \item The majority of nodes deployed in an IoT are situated within a secure property e.g., the home or office, and due to the increased cost of tamper-proofing them, node capture is not deemed to be a significant issue and will not be mitigated against in this security protocol.
\end{itemize}
% subsection assumptions (end)

\subsection{Hardware and Software Platforms} % (fold)
\label{sec:hardware_and_software_platforms}
Whilst many newer and more powerful sensor platforms are available today, much of the existing work for WSNs and WSN security has been developed for the TelosB mote, a 8Mhz TI MSP430 microcontroller with 48KB ROM and 10KB RAM, due to its low power operation and TinyOS support. TinyOS is a lightweight operating system designed for embedded devices in WSNs and has strong support in academia, with many libraries and tools available. 

% The IoT protocol previously discussed was developed for the Contiki operating system running on TelosB motes due to Contiki's relative similarity with imperative style programming, as opposed to TinyOS's event style programming. However, due to the number of security implementations available for TinyOS, including MiniSec and TinyECC, the IoT protocol will need to be ported across to TinyOS. 
\subsection{IoT Protocol} % (fold)
\label{sub:iot_protocol}
In the design of an improved and fit for purpose IoT protocol, we aim to keep radio usage as low as possible in order to maximise the lifetime of a battery operated Things, sacrificing reliability when possible, whilst still ensuring robust and predictable operation. In this section we first present the architectural model of a typical IoT network, followed by the key design areas for achieving these goals within the protocol: reliability, integrity, liveness, minimising packet headers and ensuring correct operational semantics (at-most-once/at-least-once). 

\subsubsection*{IoT Model} % (fold)
\label{ssub:iot_model}
Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, three distinct classes of devices are apparent:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sensors}, devices which sense and receive input from the real world or another service, such as temperature sensors, presence sensors etc. Data from these devices is typically non-critical, only requiring integrity and not reliability.
  \item \textbf{Actuators}, devices which represent physical or digital outputs, such as displays, lights and functions on appliances, that present an RPC interface for a controller to call. Functions provided by these devices are expected to be carried out once and only once when requested, thus reliability and acknowledgements are needed to ensure idempotent operation. 
  \item \textbf{Controllers}, typically one device such as a PC or home router, which queries, connects and manages the network of sensors and actuators, orchestrating the closed loop of interaction between sensor inputs and actuator outputs.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:model} presents our IoT model with a variety of typical Things connected to the controller, with matching colours representing the closed loop of control between each of the Things in the network. As discussed below, reliability varies between the typical operations a device performs, which is portrayed with the solid and dashed directed lines.

  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/IoT_Model.1}
\caption{IoT model}
\label{fig:model}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
% subsubsection iot_model (end)

\subsubsection*{Reliability} % (fold)
\label{ssub:reliability}
Typical Things within the IoT are low-power embedded devices, relying on wireless communication which is inherently unreliable. Thus it's necessary to implement reliability on top in order to ensure correct operation. However, whilst other approaches have simply chosen to run over TCP, which provides a fully reliable connection, our designs opts for selective reliability on top of the unreliable packet stream. This enables the protocol to ensure critical packets are sent reliably, such as connection handshakes, as well as allow devices to save power and sleep after a transmission instead of waiting for an acknowledgement when the data isn't critical, such as ephemeral sensor readings.
Similarly, to ensure at-least-once semantics for actions issued to actuators by the controller, a request-response type mechanism is used, with the controller retrying upon a response timeout. However, it is also important if response packets are lost when sent by the actuator after completing a requested action, repeat requests aren't carried out by the actuator; this is prevented by the use of monotonically increasing sequence numbers, thus ensuring at-most-once semantics.
% subsubsection reliability (end)

\subsubsection*{Liveness} % (fold)
\label{ssub:liveness}
Ensuring Things within the network are alive and accessible is another key issue, where wireless interference and batteries dying are a real problem, causing the closed loop of interaction to hang or fail and Things within the network to waste power sending packets to devices that are no longer ``out there''. To resolve this issue, checks will be performed using piggybacked messages where possible, ensuring no extra bandwidth is wasted, such as a sensor periodically requesting a response to a reading. Otherwise standard ping-ack messages will be exchanged.
% subsubsection liveness (end) 

\subsubsection*{Integrity} % (fold)
\label{ssub:integrity}
Whilst ensuring reliability of some data is not essential, it is however extremely important for received data to be correct; otherwise values corrupted in transit would appear to the controller as seemingly correct, which could then cause the controller to issue invalid commands to an actuator. To ensure integrity of the data, a hash of the data is transmitted with it and compared on the receiving side, verifying it hasn't been altered in transit.  
% subsubsection integrity (end)

\subsubsection*{Protocol data unit} % (fold)
\label{ssub:protocol_data_unit}
One of the key aims of this protocol is to ensure low energy consumption, which on an embedded devices means transmitting as little as possible over the radio, the most expensive operation. Therefore it was imperative that out protocol adds very little overhead to the already small payload size.

Figure \ref{fig:pdu} shows the protocol data unit layout for the core IoT protocol. Channels are synonymous to ports found in TCP/UDP and enable devices to hold state for more than one connection. Sequence numbers ensure packet ordering and at-most-one semantics. The command field designates the type of payload this packet holds e.g. sensor reading, handshake ack, actuator command etc. For ensuring reliability, the last bit of the command field, designated R, can be set.

\subsection{Security} % (fold)
\label{sub:security}
In this section we present the design of our security protocol, enabling new devices to join the network without the need of a shared secret or any physical interaction with the controller.
As discussed later in section \ref{sec:related_work} there are many existing security protocols available for TinyOS: including TinySec\cite{TinySec} and MiniSec\cite{MiniSec} for symmetric cryptography and TinyECC\cite{TinyECC} for asymmetric cryptography, as well as a variety of other key distribution schemes\cite{TinyPK,TinyPBC,Shi2013235,ContikiSec,MessageBottle,CertificatePairwise,MizanurRahman2010858}. The security protocol design we propose does not claim to demonstrate a completely new protocol, but is instead a novel combination of the previously described work, MiniSec and TinyECC, based on a conventional security algorithm, Transport Layer Security algorithm (TLS), commonly used in desktop machines today.

As described in section \ref{sec:motivation}, the key problem with previous approaches to WSN security is either the assumption that a shared secret, key or ID is pre-installed onto some or all of the nodes and thus not an issue, or the structure of the network is planned and predetermined, with designated high power nodes. However, this is impractical for networks containing many tens of nodes, entering in a piecemeal fashion and for administration by a novice user expecting device installation to be trivial. Thus, a secure key distribution method must be devised to ensure new nodes can join the network without the need to be reprogrammed.

To solve this problem we propose the following security protocol design described below and in figure \ref{fig:sequence_diagram}. Our design attempts to alleviate complex physical interactions between devices performed by the user\cite{MessageBottle} and remove the need to design and configure the network, which for the average home user would be non-trivial. Later sections \ref{sec:asymmetric_security} and \ref{sec:symmetric_security}, describe the choices made in designing this protocol with respect to this.

Prior to deployment nodes will need to be bootstrapped with unique public/private key pairs, public key certificate and the CA's public key. In a commercial scenario this would require cooperation with trusted manufacturers to create these keys and certificates. After this the protocol is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initiate discovery mode on the node; node now accepts and verifies incoming certificate requests.
  \item Initiate query on controller; controller sends a broadcast query with its public key certificate.
  \item The sensor receives the request with the certificate, verifies the authenticity of it using the CA public key and if successful it sends a response with its own certificate.
  \item The controller receives the response with the sensor's certificate, verifies the authenticity of it using the CA public key and replies with an acknowledgement.
  \item The sensor receives the response ack, generates a random nonce value (to protect against replay attacks), then encrypts it with the controller's public and signs it with its own private key before sending it to the controller.
  \item The controller receives the signed and encrypted nonce. It first verifies the signature, if invalid it can either request the nonce again or abort the key exchange and waste no further resources. Otherwise it then decrypts the nonce value. The controller then generates a new symmetric key, encrypts it and the nonce with the sensor's public key and signs with its own private key.
  \item The sensor receives the signed and encrypted key and nonce. It first verifies the signature, if invalid it can either request the key response again or abort the key exchange. Otherwise it then decrypts the key and nonce value, verifying that the nonce is equal to the one it sent earlier, confirming the key response has not been replayed. Using the symmetric key, the sensor then initialises the symmetric encryption code and then sends a handover message to the controller to signal it received the key and is ready to communicate using it.
  \item The controller then receives the symmetric handover message and replies with an acknowledge. The two devices can now communicate securely.

\section{Asymmetric Security} % (fold)
\label{sec:asymmetric_security}
\subsection{TinyECC} % (fold)
\label{sub:tinyecc}
To enable secure key distribution, asymmetric cryptography provided by elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using TinyECC\cite{TinyECC} will be used. Whilst TinyECC demonstrates the feasibility of using software based public key cryptography via ECC on low power microcontrollers, it is still extremely expensive in respect to code size (\textgreater15KB), RAM utilisation (3KB) and operational speed, taking up to 5 seconds per operation. Therefore, it's necessary to use it as little as possible and switch over to the far cheaper symmetric key cryptography to keep the connection secure for the rest of its lifetime, in which encrypt and decrypt operations takes \textless 2ms.
% subsubsection tinyecc (end)

\subsection{Denial of service protection} % (fold)
\label{sub:denial_of_service_protection}
Because of the significant cost in verifying a certificate, it would be possible for an attacker to perform a denial of service attack on a node by sending it fake certificates. To reduce the severity of this attack, Things in the network will only accept and process asymmetric packets throughout a set window of time after the user presses a button on the device. This also provides demonstrative identification for the user, enabling them to physically control and understand which devices are communicating, similar to WIFI protected setup (WPS) built into commodity home routers.
% subsection denial_of_service_protection (end)

\subsection{Man-in-the-middle protection} % (fold)
\label{sub:man_in_the_middle_protection}
However, using TinyECC alone will not ensure authentication and won't protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. To perform authentication we propose the use of an offline trusted certificate authority (CA) to create public key certificates for nodes. These certificates are then installed on the nodes at compile time along with the nodes private/public key pair and the CA's public key. This enables new nodes to have their public key certificate authenticated by other nodes using the CA's public key, before the node's respective public keys are used to exchange the key. This enables nodes to join and rejoin new networks without a previously bootstrapped shared secret symmetric key, unlike other pre-deployment approaches which would require re-bootstrapping the device with the new shared secret symmetric key every time it joined a new network.

After the nodes have verified each other's authenticity, they are then able to exchange the symmetric key in secret using asymmetric encryption and decryption, followed by handing the connection over to use just symmetric cryptography. 
% subsection man_in_the_middle_protection (end)

\subsection{Optimisations} % (fold)
\label{sub:optimisations}
To enable ECC to operate within reasonable time bounds on microcontroller platforms, such as the TelosB mote, various optimisations were made in TinyECC, which use precomputed tables and values created at initialisation to speed up the cryptographic operations. When using TinyECC to perform encryption and authentication, the state computed by these operations overlaps, requiring re-initialisation between operations. To reduce this overhead, we implemented state saving and switching, requiring initialisation to be performed only once for each encryption and authentication modules, saving valuable seconds over the entire key exchange. The benefits are further detailed in the evaluation in section \ref{sec:evaluation}.
% subsection optimisations (end)

\subsection{Asymmetric costs} % (fold)
\label{sub:asymmetric_payload_sizes}
Whilst the overarching aim of our IoT protocol is to transmit little and save as much power as possible, due to the use of asymmetric cryptography for public keys and certificates in which keys and certificates are 40bytes and 20bytes respectively, large packet sizes are unavoidable. Similarly, whilst TinyECC makes public key computations feasible on embedded devices, combining them in the protocol we propose to provide both authentication and encryption over an insecure channel for the key exchange results in a one time high cost, taking between 30 and 40 seconds to complete. However, because it's only performed once, the high initial cost is amortised over the lifetime of the node. 
% subsection asymmetric_payload_sizes (end)

\section{Symmetric Security} % (fold)
\label{sec:symmetric_security}
\subsection{Block cipher algorithm and mode of operation} % (fold)
\label{sub:cipher_block_algorithm_and_mode_of_operation}
After the handover has occurred, symmetric cryptography will be used to keep the connection secure for the duration of its lifetime. The symmetric cryptography used is based on the MiniSec implementation ported from Rogoway et al's Offset Code Book mode of operation(OCB)\cite{OCB} and Law et al's Skipjack block cipher algorithm\cite{Skipjack} implementations. However, due to the inadequacy of various parts of the extended implementation by MiniSec\cite{MiniSecLink}, including being written for TinyOS 1.0, allowing only one encrypted connection per node, various memory allocation bugs and inefficient IV synchronisation, much of the code was rewritten to be work correctly and more efficiently for TinyOS 2.1. 
% subsection cipher_block_algorithm_and_mode_of_operation (end)

\subsection{Man-in-the-middle and Masquerading protection} % (fold)
\label{sub:man_in_the_middle_and_masquerading_protection}
Similar to the asymmetric component of the protocol, to prevent man-in-the-middle and masquerading attacks, authentication is necessary, ensuring that a message sent from a Thing in the network is genuine and hasn't been tampered with in transit. To do this a message authentication code (MAC) block needs to be generated from the encrypted data. Unlike cipher block chaining (CBC) and CBC message authentication code (CBC-MAC), which encrypt/decrypt and authenticate the data independently using two unique keys; by using the offset code book (OCB) mode of operation for block ciphering, both encryption/decryption and authentication are completed in one pass over the data using just one key, realising a slight decrease in time\cite{ContikiSec} and significant saving in space used for storing the key.
% subsection man_in_the_middle_and_masquerading_protection (end)

\subsection{Semantic security} % (fold)
\label{sub:semantic_security}
In order to ensure semantic security, in which duplicate packets don't encrypt to the same ciphertext, a 64-bit monotonically increasing initialisation vector (IV) is used for each connection. This would normally require the 64-bits IV to be transmitted to the receiving node, which is extremely costly when attached to each packet. However, using the last bits (LB) optimisation coined in MiniSec, we are able to just transmit the last n bits of the counter and with some resynchronisation logic on both ends, withstand packet loss of up to $2^n$ packets before resynchronisation occurs. In our protocol we chose to send the last 6 bits of the counter, due to sharing the byte with another field. In the case of the IV wrapping around, to remain semantically secure the controller only needs to generate a new symmetric key and distribute it before the wrap occurs.
% subsection semantic_security (end)

When MiniSec was developed, Skipjack was chosen as the underlying block-cipher due to its efficient implementation and low memory footprint\cite{Skipjack}. However, Skipjack uses a maximum key length of 80-bits, which as of 2010 NIST classifies as insecure for long term use\cite{NIST}. As a temporary measure, the controller can choose to re-issue a new session key for each node after an arbitrary period of time.

\section{Related Work} % (fold)
\label{sec:related_work}
\subsection{IoT protocols} % (fold)
\label{sub:iot_protocols}
Given the recent surge of popularity for the Internet of things many developers, manufacturers and standards bodies have attempted to create a solution for their view of the IoT, each differing greatly and locked with their own ecosystems. 

The IETF Core working group have proposed a new standard, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\cite{IETF_COAP_HTTP}, which aims to manipulate Things within the IoT to fit into the traditional RESTful client-server architecture that is commonplace on the Internet today, removing the need for specialised platforms or applications to access them. The protocol is built to operate on unreliable UDP links, providing support for reliable delivery on top when needed. In an attempt to be power-friendly, services can subscribe to Things, such as sensors, instead of polling for updates from these devices, allowing them to save power and enter sleep modes. Whilst bringing Things into the client-server architecture eases the adoption of such devices, it forces them to adopt an architecture that simply isn't suited for them considering their low power constraints placing restrictions on their availability, reliability and resources. Similarly, it also potentially poses serious security risks if simply plugged-in to the Internet\cite{BelkinWemo}.

Building on top of this the OpenWSN project at UC Berkeley proposes a software stack sitting on top of the 802.15.4 enabled device and below CoAP/HTTP, consisting of 6Lowpan, a compressed IPv6 for embedded devices, combined with RPL an IPv6 routing protocol for lossy wireless networks and TCP/UDP transport protocols.

As previously discussed, many manufacturer have thoughtlessly integrated power-hungry WIFI chipsets and connect the devices directly to the Internet or to their Cloud service\cite{SmartThings,Belkin,Twine}, without any closed loop interaction happening locally between devices. Whilst these devices gain the power and connectivity of the cloud, this couples them directly to them, and vastly increase the chances of failure, due to services going down, limited Internet connectivity and potentially raises issues regard data ownership and privacy/loss\cite{Playstation}. However, as a result of this direct Internet and Cloud connectivity, devices needlessly waste power and are at a greater risk to security threats\cite{BelkinWemo,IoTWorm}. 
% subsection iot_protocols (end)
\subsection{WSN Security} % (fold)
\label{sub:wsn_security}
There has been a myriad of different attempts to efficiently secure WSNs \cite{TinySec,MiniSec,TinyECC,TinyPK,TinyPBC,Shi2013235,ContikiSec,MessageBottle,CertificatePairwise,MizanurRahman2010858}, however none matched the requirements of the IoT.

TinySec\cite{TinySec}, a symmetric cryptography library for TinyOS 1.0, was some of the initial work for TinyOS to address security, intending to demonstrate that software-based cryptography was possible on constrained devices with a minimal power overhead. To achieve this, TinySec was designed around WSNs extreme resource constraints, taking advantage of some of these constraints, such as the limited networking bandwidth, optimising the security primitives in order to reduce the security overhead added to each packet. One such optimisation was the use of a reduced initialisation vector for the cipher block chaining mode of operation, which combined several of the existing header fields and added a 2 byte counter, ensuring the initialisation vectors wouldn't clash between nodes sending the same packet. Whilst the IV is significantly smaller than conventional security protocols, which would reduce time till IV reuse, TinySec argued that this wasn't an issue, demonstrating that using an average send rate of 1 packet per minute, IV reuse would not occur for 45 days.

MiniSec, another symmetric cryptography library for TinyOS 1.0 and a successor to TinySec, was created to further improve the security provided by TinySec, add replay prevention and also improve upon the minimal security overheads which TinySec achieved. To achieve the increase in security, MiniSec chose to increase the initialisation vector size from 2 bytes to 8 bytes, however, instead of transmitting the whole 8 bytes, MiniSec sends only the 3 last bits (LB) within the pre-existing packet length field, thus incurring no additional overhead on top of the normal TinyOS packet for the IV. To ensure the LB optimisation works correctly, both communicating nodes must maintain state for the counter and perform counter resynchronisation upon significant packet loss (\textgreater$2^3$ packets). This counter state is also used to ensure replay prevention, requiring all received packets to have a higher IV than the local state.\footnote{Whilst the MiniSec paper presented an efficient symmetric cryptography protocol design, the corresponding implementation provided at \cite{MiniSecLink} does not appear to function correctly (with various runtime issues) or implement the IV counter using the LB optimisation described.}

Until recently, asymmetric security, namely RSA, was deemed infeasible on microcontroller platforms, taking in the order of tens of seconds to complete public key operations\cite{TinyECC}. However, this is no longer the case with the development of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), in which not only are public key operations feasible within several seconds, but key lengths are reduced whilst still providing the same level of security as longer keys in more traditional asymmetric algorithms such as RSA. 

There are many other complex key distribution schemes which require hierarchical networks of devices \cite{MizanurRahman2010858,Shi2013235} and predetermined deployment strategies to enable efficient key distribution. Rahmun et al present a solution for such a hierarchical network\cite{MizanurRahman2010858}, consisting of a network of heterogeneous nodes, in which high resource nodes store node IDs for surrounding low resource nodes and provide authentication for the key exchange process between low resource nodes using ECC. However, this scheme requires expensive high resource nodes that need to have the low resource node IDs stored ahead of time, and also need to be tamper resistant to protect against node capture, further increasing the cost. Another viable alternative, pairings-based key distribution schemes, such as TinyPBC\cite{TinyPBC}, provide efficient key pairings (\textless5s) but require nodes know each other's ID a priori, which can prove difficult to do with authentication. 

Other proposed key distribution schemes such as TinyPK aim to sacrifice immediate authenticity and security on the mote by only performing the public key operations on the more power server side \cite{TinyPK}. In contrast to this, Message-in-a-bottle \cite{MessageBottle} relies entirely on a portable faraday cage like barrier to allow to devices to communicate in the clear in secret. Whilst it achieved the goal of distributing keys, it sacrifices elegance, usability and scalability, by having to manually place devices inside a lead pipe each time a key needs to be issued.
