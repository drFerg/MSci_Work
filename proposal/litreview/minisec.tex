MiniSec was created to tackle several problems apparent in the then current WSN security protocols, TinySec and Zigbee. The pre-cursor to MiniSec, TinySec, received much attention and use due to its power and resource efficient security implementation, but because of a lack of authentication and replay prevention the overall security of it is insufficient to protect a WSN. An commercial alternative, Zigbee, has significantly higher security, but does so at the cost of high energy consumption. MiniSec was designed to find the middle-ground between the two, increasing security whilst remaining energy efficient. 

\textbf{TODO: Discuss improved security, improved E+AUTH with OCB, use of authentication (OCB) and replay prevention mechanism}
