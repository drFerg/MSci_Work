\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{chapquote}{Mark Weiser, \textit{The Computer for the Twenty-First Century, 1991}}
    ``The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.''
\end{chapquote}

The modern home is becoming increasingly filled with a variety of \textit{connected} devices (laptops, tablets, phones, set-top boxes etc.), providing a myriad of different services to users within the home. On top of this, with the advent use of smart phones and introduction of wearable devices, we too are starting to carry around our own personal network of devices everywhere we go, brushing past many others in our daily lives at home, work and on the street. Although all connected to the Internet, these devices are often encapsulated within their own environment and ecosystem, unable to interconnect, creating a fractured and often complex user experience. 

Making matters more interesting, the Internet of Things paradigm is once again becoming a field of great interest due to the advent of cheap, low power wireless embedded devices \cite{2013IoT}. However, not much consideration has been made for how these Things should be integrated into the existing home network, with many approaches opting to simply bridge the device to the cloud (\cite{SmartThings}, \cite{Twine}, \cite{IETF_CORE}), with obvious concerns for security, privacy and up-time.

As these devices enter our homes and pockets, bringing with them their own ecosystems, the user is faced with the increasingly difficult burden of managing all of them and the ecosystems \cite{brundell2011w}, \cite{brown2013multinet}. Due to the sheer number and diversity of these devices, many of which will provide overlapping services and functionality, problems arise in how to ensure these devices not only play nicely together but also ensuring the user's network and information stays secure against new and unanticipated threats.

In order for these multiple layered networks of devices to truly fade away into the fabric of our everyday lives, a platform and relevant protocols need to be engineered to not only support this heterogeneous network securely, but also aid the user in managing both the network and the privacy of their information.

The Homework home router platform was created to these issues. Rather than assume every user is a network administrator, the project investigated the needs and abilities of the average user in order to propose the future of home networking, re-inventing the protocols, models and architectures to truly suit the home environment. This re-invention of the home router allows a user to easily install, manage and use their home network, without the need of a Cisco qualification.

In regards to the Internet of Things development, previous work demonstrated that it was in need a suitable protocol in order to meet the specific needs of a network of Things \cite{KNoT}. Thus, a new protocol was designed and implemented, which could not only run on even the most constrained battery-powered devices (8MHz), but it could also efficiently scale to support hundreds of Things within the same network.

\section{Statement of Problem}
Whilst there have been many attempts, both past and recent, to create the perfect Internet of Things network for the home, many still exhibit several issues. This section will first present a typical user scenario to provide a context for this problem, then discuss several of the issues found in existing work, both our previous work and others', which provide the motivation for this project.

\subsection{A Scenario} % (fold)
\label{sub:scenario}
In order to establish the context of the problem, a typical user scenario has been created to demonstrate a user purchasing a new Thing and attempting to integrate it into their network securely.

\textit{Bob buys a new Thing, a motion sensor, from a shop and brings it home. He wants to connect it to his currently existing home network. To do so, Bob turns on the Thing and presses the connect button on both the Thing and his home router. Using his tablet/PC Bob is able to view the newly available Things in the network that he can connect to, in which he can see his new Thing. Bob is able to view various information about the Thing, including it's type, manufacturer, functions etc. Bob selects the Thing he wants to connect to the network and within a minute the new thing is now part of the network and he can then customise how he wants to use it in the network.}

\subsection{The Problem} % (fold)
\label{sub:the_problem}
The Internet of Things protocol created in \cite{KNoT} proved to be a successful proof-of-concept; However, in order for it to be considered for deployment and integration into existing homes, two main issues need to first be addressed.

\subsubsection{Security} % (fold)
\label{ssub:security}

The initial design of the IoT protocol didn't consider security due to time constraints; However, because such rich and sensitive data can be gathered about the user and their home from Thing's, it becomes extremely important to not only protect the data from unauthorised persons, but also protect the network itself. The IoT protocol needs to be sufficiently secured to prevent eavesdropping of the transmitted data and injection of false events by perpetrators masquerading as sanctioned participants in the network. 

Demonstrated in the scenario, a user may want to purchase any kind of compatible Thing from a shop and then want bring it into their home network with minimal effort. The Thing itself would have no prior knowledge of the network and needs a secure mechanism to enter the network without compromising the rest of the network or exposing its own data to unauthorised users. 
% subsubsection security (end)

\subsubsection{Integration} % (fold)
\label{ssub:integration}

The current implementation exists as a standalone library with several demo applications. Integration of the IoT protocol into a user-friendly platform is necessary to harness the full power of a network of Things. The integrated platform would then be able to discover and connect to available Things, subscribe and log events from the sensors and using user customised rules, use automata to detect if these rules are met and then perform actions by publishing commands to actuators in the network.
% subsubsection integration (end)

\subsection{Intranet of Things vs Internet of Things} % (fold)
\label{sub:intranet_of_things}

As described earlier in section \ref{sec:introduction}, many previous deployments of Internet of Things networks have taken a cloud first approach, see \cite{SmartThings, Twine}. Whilst this yields certain benefits, such as easy external access and integration with other services \cite{IFTTT, Xively}, it also poses several questions regards data security, privacy and up-time. For this project, the focus will be on developing a home first platform, in which all Things communication will be kept local, with no cloud processing involved; Thus a more suitable name, the Intranet of Things, will be used.

% subsection problems_with_previous_work (end)
Typical wireless sensor network security has considered and used symmetric cryptography\cite{TinySec,luk2007minisec, ContikiSec} for securing networks in the wild, however key distribution has been bootstrapped (burned to ROM) prior to deployment. This would not only increase the difficulty of bringing a new Thing into a home network, but would also require each Thing have additional hardware in order to interface with the key distributor i.e. PC. 

Alternatively, asymmetric cryptography has also been proved viable on typical WSN platforms thanks to elliptic curve cryptography which provides significant performance benefits of previously existing methods\cite{TinyECC}; Therefore allowing pairs of nodes in a network to dynamically create shared keys. Whilst there is some improvement in performance, it still considerably slower and consumes far more resources than symmetric cryptography, as shown in table \ref{tab:crypto_compare}.

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

There has been significant research into WSN security \cite{TinySec, luk2007minisec, ContikiSec, TinyECC,MessageBottle, CertificatePairwise, Karlof_Wagner_2003, SecurityInWSN}, covering both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography for various WSN platforms. However, in networks where symmetric cryptography was used, deployment of shared encryption keys was either not described or burned to ROM\cite{TinySec, luk2007minisec, ContikiSec} prior to a node's deployment. In the case of asymmetric cryptography, research has just proven that it was viable on WSN platforms\cite{TinyECC}. Little has been done to present a fully deployable and dynamic secure WSN that is suitable for the home.
